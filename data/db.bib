@article{dcapc,
  abstract     = {In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), one essential issue is Medium Access Control (MAC), which addresses how to utilize the radio spectrum efficiently and to resolve potential contention and collision among mobile hosts on using the medium. Existing works have been dedicated to using multiple channels and power control to improve the performance of MANET. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of bringing the concepts of power control and multi-channel medium access together in the MAC design problem in a MANET. Existing protocols only address one of these issues independently. The proposed protocol is characterized by the following features: (i) it follows an ‘on-demand’ style to assign channels to mobile hosts, (ii) the number of channels required is independent of the network topology and degree, (iii) it flexibly adapts to host mobility, (iv) no form of clock synchronization is required and (v) power control is used to exploit frequency reuse. Power control may also extend battery life and reduce signal interference, both of which are important in wireless communication. Through simulations, we demonstrate the advantage of our new protocol.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the implementation architecture and performance analysis of nanoMAC, a CSMA/CA based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, which is specifically designed for high density Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We empirically show that nanoMAC performs with high reliability in a variety of network traffic conditions in single and multihop scenarios. For energy efficient operation and minimising idle-overhearing, nanoMAC uses a specialised sleep algorithm. We also show results from a comparative study of nanoMAC with Berkeley's MAC (B-MAC) in terms of performance measures, as well as their coexistence in networks deployed in overlapping or nearby areas.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces RL-MAC, a novel adaptive Media Access Control (MAC) protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that employs a reinforcement learning framework. Existing schemes centre around scheduling the nodes' sleep and active periods as means of minimising the energy consumption. Recent protocols employ adaptive duty cycles as means of further optimising the energy utilisation. However, in most cases each node determines the duty cycle as a function of its own traffic load. In this paper, nodes actively infer the state of other nodes, using a reinforcement learning based control mechanism, thereby achieving high thoughput and low power consumption for a wide range of traffic conditions. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is moderate rendering it pragmatic for practical deployments.},

  abstract     = {Mobility in wireless sensor networks poses unique challenges to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. Previous MAC protocols for sensor networks assume static sensor nodes and focus on energy-efficiency. In this paper, we present MMAC, a mobility-adaptive, collision-free MAC protocol for mobile sensor networks. MMAC caters for both weak mobility (e.g. topology changes, node joins and node failures) and strong mobility (e.g. concurrent node joins and failures, and physical mobility of nodes). When using MMAC, nodes are allowed to transmit at particular time-slots, based on the traffic information and mobility pattern of the nodes. Allowing transmission at particular time-slots makes MMAC a scheduling-based protocol, thereby guaranteeing collision avoidance. Simulation results indicate that the performance of MMAC is equivalent to that of TRAMA in static sensor network environments. In sensor networks with mobile nodes or high network dynamics, MMAC outperforms existing MAC protocols, including TRAMA and S-MAC, in terms of energy-efficiency, delay and packet delivery.},

@article{areamac,
  abstract     = {Energy saving has been the primal issue in designing medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, with the advent of new micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies and recently thermo-powered and solar-powered sensor nodes – where nodes operate virtually for an unlimited time period – the research community is set to experience many diverse directions in this area. Factors like timeliness, scalability, synchronisation, adaptivity and reliability will play their part in the near future. This paper discusses AREA-MAC, a MAC protocol specially designed for real-time and energy-efficient WSN applications. AREA-MAC reduces latency and energy consumption of nodes by using low power listening (LPL) technique with short preamble messages. Other protocols like B-MAC use long preamble messages that cause higher latency, energy consumption and control overhead. Moreover, AREA-MAC provides reasonable trade-offs between vital parameters such as system fairness, throughput, scalability and adaptability to traffic conditions. Additionally, to minimise network latency and to maximise its lifetime, two application-based optimisation problems are formulated. The analytical and simulation results show a better performance of AREA-MAC in terms of delay, energy-efficiency, throughput and overhearing over the protocols which use LPL with long preambles.},
