@article{dcapc,
  abstract     = {In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), one essential issue is Medium Access Control (MAC), which addresses how to utilize the radio spectrum efficiently and to resolve potential contention and collision among mobile hosts on using the medium. Existing works have been dedicated to using multiple channels and power control to improve the performance of MANET. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of bringing the concepts of power control and multi-channel medium access together in the MAC design problem in a MANET. Existing protocols only address one of these issues independently. The proposed protocol is characterized by the following features: (i) it follows an ‘on-demand’ style to assign channels to mobile hosts, (ii) the number of channels required is independent of the network topology and degree, (iii) it flexibly adapts to host mobility, (iv) no form of clock synchronization is required and (v) power control is used to exploit frequency reuse. Power control may also extend battery life and reduce signal interference, both of which are important in wireless communication. Through simulations, we demonstrate the advantage of our new protocol.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the implementation architecture and performance analysis of nanoMAC, a CSMA/CA based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, which is specifically designed for high density Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We empirically show that nanoMAC performs with high reliability in a variety of network traffic conditions in single and multihop scenarios. For energy efficient operation and minimising idle-overhearing, nanoMAC uses a specialised sleep algorithm. We also show results from a comparative study of nanoMAC with Berkeley's MAC (B-MAC) in terms of performance measures, as well as their coexistence in networks deployed in overlapping or nearby areas.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces RL-MAC, a novel adaptive Media Access Control (MAC) protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that employs a reinforcement learning framework. Existing schemes centre around scheduling the nodes' sleep and active periods as means of minimising the energy consumption. Recent protocols employ adaptive duty cycles as means of further optimising the energy utilisation. However, in most cases each node determines the duty cycle as a function of its own traffic load. In this paper, nodes actively infer the state of other nodes, using a reinforcement learning based control mechanism, thereby achieving high thoughput and low power consumption for a wide range of traffic conditions. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is moderate rendering it pragmatic for practical deployments.},

  abstract     = {Mobility in wireless sensor networks poses unique challenges to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. Previous MAC protocols for sensor networks assume static sensor nodes and focus on energy-efficiency. In this paper, we present MMAC, a mobility-adaptive, collision-free MAC protocol for mobile sensor networks. MMAC caters for both weak mobility (e.g. topology changes, node joins and node failures) and strong mobility (e.g. concurrent node joins and failures, and physical mobility of nodes). When using MMAC, nodes are allowed to transmit at particular time-slots, based on the traffic information and mobility pattern of the nodes. Allowing transmission at particular time-slots makes MMAC a scheduling-based protocol, thereby guaranteeing collision avoidance. Simulation results indicate that the performance of MMAC is equivalent to that of TRAMA in static sensor network environments. In sensor networks with mobile nodes or high network dynamics, MMAC outperforms existing MAC protocols, including TRAMA and S-MAC, in terms of energy-efficiency, delay and packet delivery.},

@article{areamac,
  abstract     = {Energy saving has been the primal issue in designing medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, with the advent of new micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies and recently thermo-powered and solar-powered sensor nodes – where nodes operate virtually for an unlimited time period – the research community is set to experience many diverse directions in this area. Factors like timeliness, scalability, synchronisation, adaptivity and reliability will play their part in the near future. This paper discusses AREA-MAC, a MAC protocol specially designed for real-time and energy-efficient WSN applications. AREA-MAC reduces latency and energy consumption of nodes by using low power listening (LPL) technique with short preamble messages. Other protocols like B-MAC use long preamble messages that cause higher latency, energy consumption and control overhead. Moreover, AREA-MAC provides reasonable trade-offs between vital parameters such as system fairness, throughput, scalability and adaptability to traffic conditions. Additionally, to minimise network latency and to maximise its lifetime, two application-based optimisation problems are formulated. The analytical and simulation results show a better performance of AREA-MAC in terms of delay, energy-efficiency, throughput and overhearing over the protocols which use LPL with long preambles.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces human energy harvesting medium access control (MAC) protocol (HEH-BMAC), a hybrid polling MAC suitable for wireless body area networks powered by human energy harvesting. The proposed protocol combines two different medium access methods, namely polling (ID-polling) and probabilistic contention access, to adapt its operation to the different energy and state (active/inactive) changes that the network nodes may experience due to their random nature and the time variation of the energy harvesting sources. HEH-BMAC exploits the packet inter-arrival time and the energy harvesting rate information of each node to implement an efficient access scheme with different priority levels. In addition, our protocol can be applied dynamically in realistic networks, since it is adaptive to the topology changes, allowing the insertion/removal of wireless sensor nodes. Extensive simulations have been conducted in order to evaluate the protocol performance and study the throughput and energy tradeoffs.},

  abstract     = {Targeting the medical monitoring applications of wireless body area networks (WBANs), a hybrid medium access control protocol using an interrupt mechanism (I-MAC) is proposed to improve the energy and time slot utilization efficiency and to meet the data delivery delay requirement at the same time. Unlike existing hybrid MAC protocols, a superframe structure with a longer length is adopted to avoid unnecessary beacons. The time slots are mostly allocated to nodes with periodic data sources. Short interruption slots are inserted into the superframe to convey the urgent data and to guarantee the real-time requirements of these data. During these interruption slots, the coordinator can break the running superframe and start a new superframe. A contention access period (CAP) is only activated when there are more data that need to be delivered. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed MAC protocol in WBANs with low urgent traffic.},

  abstract      = {In wireless body area networks (WBANs), various sensors and actuators are placed on/inside the human body and connected wirelessly. WBANs have specific requirements for healthcare and medical applications, hence, standard protocols like the IEEE 802.15.4 cannot fulfill all the requirements. Consequently, many medium access control (MAC) protocols, mostly derived from the IEEE 802.15.4 superframe structure, have been studied. Nevertheless, they do not support a differentiated quality of service (QoS) for the various forms of traffic coexisting in a WBAN. In particular, a QoS-aware MAC protocol is essential for WBANs operating in the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands, because different wireless services like Bluetooth, WiFi, and Zigbee may coexist there and cause severe interference. In this paper, we propose a priority-based adaptive MAC (PA-MAC) protocol for WBANs in unlicensed bands, which allocates time slots dynamically, based on the traffic priority. Further, multiple channels are effectively utilized to reduce access delays in a WBAN, in the presence of coexisting systems. Our performance evaluation results show that the proposed PA-MAC outperforms the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the conventional priority-based MAC in terms of the average transmission time, throughput, energy consumption, and data collision ratio.},

  abstract     = {In a regular wireless ad hoc network, the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol coordinates channel access among nodes, and the throughput of the network is limited by the bandwidth of a single channel. The multi-channel MAC protocols can exploit multiple channels to achieve high network throughput by enabling more concurrent transmissions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and adaptive protocol, called H-MMAC, which utilizes multi-channel resources more efficiently than other multi-channel MAC protocols. The main idea is to adopt the IEEE 802.11 Power Saving Mechanism and to allow nodes to transmit data packets while other nodes try to negotiate the data channel during the Ad hoc Traffic Indication Message window based on the network traffic load. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed H-MMAC protocol improves the network performance significantly in terms of the aggregate throughput, average delay, fairness and energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing demands for high-quality health-care services, medical cyber-physical systems over wireless body sensor networks have emerged as a promising solution for vital life signals monitoring. These systems require the communication protocols to be both reliable and real-time in data transmissions. IEEE 802.15.4 can be regarded as the canonical protocols in this area owing to its low-power and low-cost features. However, it falls short of reliability and timeliness guarantees. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive MAC protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4, namely Ada-MAC. The proposed protocol combines schedule-based on time-triggered protocol and contention-based CSMA/CA mechanism. It can not only enable dynamic Guaranteed Time Slots allocation but also provide differentiated services for different nodes according to their data types. The proposed protocol is implemented on the OMNeT++ platform. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of Ada-MAC in comparison with the traditional IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. The results show the superiority of the proposed protocol in terms of reliability and timeliness.},

  abstract     = {Directional communication in wireless sensor networks minimizes interference and thereby increases reliability and throughput of the network. Hence, directional wireless sensor networks (DWSNs) are fastly attracting the interests of researchers and industry experts around the globe. However, in DWSNs the conventional medium access control protocols face some new challenges including the synchronization among the nodes, directional hidden terminal and deafness problems, etc. For taking the advantages of spatial reusability and increased coverage from directional communications, a low duty cycle directional Medium Access control protocol for mobility based DWSNs, termed as DCD-MAC, is developed in this paper. To reduce energy consumption due to idle listening, duty cycling is extensively used in WSNs. In DCD-MAC, each pair of parent and child sensor nodes performs synchronization with each other before data communication. The nodes in the network schedule their time of data transmissions in such a way that the number of collisions occurred during transmissions from multiple nodes is minimized. The sensor nodes are kept active only when the nodes need to communicate with each other. The DCD-MAC exploits localized information of mobile nodes in a distributed manner and thus it gives weighted fair access of transmission slots to the nodes. As a final point, we have studied the performance of our proposed protocol through extensive simulations in NS-3 and the results show that the DCD-MAC gives better reliability, throughput, end-to-end delay, network lifetime and overhead comparing to the related directional MAC protocols.},

  abstract     = {Using multiple channels in wireless networks improves spatial reuse and reduces collision probability and thus enhances network throughput. Designing a multi-channel MAC protocol is challenging because multi-channel-specific issues such as channel assignment, the multi-channel hidden terminal problem, and the missing receiver problem, must be solved. Most existing multi-channel MAC protocols suffer from either higher hardware cost or poor throughput. Some channel hopping multi-channel protocols achieve pretty good performance in certain situations but fail to adjust their channel hopping mechanisms according to varied traffic loads. In this paper, we propose a load-aware channel hopping MAC protocol (LACH) that solves all the multi-channel-specific problems mentioned above.LACH enables nodes to dynamically adjust their schedules based on their traffic loads. In addition to load awareness, LACH has several other attractive features: (1) Each node is equipped with a single half-duplex transceiver. (2) Each node's initial hopping sequence is generated by its ID. Knowing the neighbor nodes' IDs, a node can calculate its neighbors' initial channel hopping sequences without control packet exchanges. (3) Nodes can be evenly distributed among available channels. Through performance analysis, simulations, and real system implementation, we verify that LACH is a promising protocol suitable for a network with time-varied traffic loads.},

@article{ddcmac,
  abstract      = {In this paper, a dynamic cooperative MAC protocol (DDC-MAC) based on cluster network topology is proposed, which has the capability of differentiated service mechanisms and long-range communication. In DDC-MAC, heterogeneous communications are classified according to service types and quality of service (QoS) requirements, i.e., periodic communication mode (PC mode) is extracted with a QoS guarantee for high-frequency periodic information exchange based on adapt-TDMA mechanisms, while other services are classified as being in on-demand communication mode (OC mode), which includes channel contention and access mechanisms based on a multiple priority algorithm. OC mode is embedded into the adapt-TDMA process adaptively, and the two communication modes can work in parallel. Furthermore, adaptive array hybrid antenna systems and cooperative communication with optimal relay are presented, to exploit the opportunity for long-range transmission, while an adaptive channel back-off sequence is deduced, to mitigate packet collision and network congestion. Moreover, we developed an analytical framework to quantify the performance of the DDC-MAC protocol and conducted extensive simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed DDC-MAC protocol enhances network performance in diverse scenarios, and significantly improves network throughput and reduces average delay compared with other MAC protocols.},

@article{eecomac,
  abstract     = {This paper presents an energy-efficient cooperative MAC (EECO-MAC) protocol using power control in mobile ad hoc networks. Cooperative communications improve network performance by taking full advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. The power control technique improves the network lifetime by adjusting the transmission power dynamically. We propose the best partnership selection algorithm, which takes energy consumption into consideration for selection of the optimal cooperative helper to join in the transmission. Through exchanging control packets, the optimal transmission power is allocated for senders to transmit data packets to receivers. In order to enhance energy saving, space--time backoff and time--space backoff algorithms are proposed. Simulation results show that EECO-MAC consumes less energy and prolongs the network lifetime compared to IEEE 802.11 DCF and CoopMAC at the cost of delay. Performance improvement offered by our proposed protocol is apparent in congested networks where nodes have low and limited energy.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in a variety of applications to sense and transfer information to the centralized node with energy efficiency increasing the network's lifespan. Other factors, such as quality of service (QoS) is also important to improve the performance of the WSNs, by increasing throughput and reducing end-to-end delay. In this paper, we evaluate the importance of QoS in the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for WSNs using different metrics and parameters such as energy efficiency, throughput, delay, and the network lifespan. We propose a new QoS MAC protocol, ``PRIority in Node'' (PRIN), using static priority in the source and the intermediate node and priority among the node which is one hop from the sink node to achieve QoS in WSNs. Simulation results are compared with those of the synchronous MAC protocol in terms of QoS parameters to show the improved performance of the proposed MAC protocol.},
