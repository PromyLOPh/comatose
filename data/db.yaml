# Performance Objectives: Energy (no, n/a, duty-cycling), delay (node-to-node/end-to-end decrease/probalistic guarantee/guarantee), reliability (no, node-to-node/end-to-end increase/guarantee)
# Assumptions: Deployment, Topology, Network Pattern, Cross-Layer Support, Transceiver

# gummalla:
# Architecture: Distributed (Collision avoidance, random access), Centralized (random access, guaranteed access, hybrid access)

# jurdak2004:
# Channels (single, multiple), Topology (single-hop, multi-hop, clustered, centralized), Transmission initiation (sender/receiver), Power efficient, Traffic load/scalabiliy, Range

# demirkol2006: time sync needed, comm pattern support (all, convergecast), type (csma, np-csma, tdma/csma, csma/ca, tdma) adaptivity (good, weak)

# mo2008 (only multichannel mac): dedicated control channel, common hopping, split phase, parallel rendezvous

# kumar2014: fixed, demand, hybrid assignment, random access; design
# considerations: node deployment (topology?), control packet overhead, time
# synchronization (local/global), slot scheduling, duty-cycling, multi-channel,
# cross-layer support, channel utilization, node priority, collision avoidance
# Main classes are: energy-efficient, qos-aware, real-time

# several: hard- vs soft real-time

# pip: coordinated (tdma)/uncoordinated (tdma), centralized/distributed,
# single/multichannel, connection-oriented/-less

# old
# ^^^

# Slot assignment strategies
# --------------------------
# fixed: fixed (time/freq/…) slot assignment
# slot-reservation: nodes reserve slots for data-transmissions. While
#     the actual data-transfer is collision-free the reservation is not
# token-passing:
# polling: 

# Topology
# --------
# centralized
# cluster
# single-hop: mac layer relies on higher layers to transmit packet to out-of-range stations
# multi-hop

# rtscts: rts/cts/data/ack slot reservation mechanism

# distributed: Distributed access control

# backoff: Uses exponential backoff in case of collisions
# carriersense: Station senses medium before sending

# synchronized: A synchronized clock is required

# fixed-slotsize: You name it.
